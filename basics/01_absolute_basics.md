# Absolute basics of R, RStudio, RStudio Cloud, Git, and GitHub

## What is R?

R is an interactive environment developed by statisticians for data analysis.\
A more detailed Introduction to R can be found at https://www.r-project.org. \
Below is a sample screenshot of an R session on a local computer:

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R developed by J J Allaire.\
RStudio provides a convenient graphical interface to R, making it more user-friendly, and providing many useful features.\
Such features include direct code execution, tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.\
A more detailed background on to RStudio can be found at https://www.rstudio.com/about/.

## What is RStudio Cloud?

RStudio Cloud is a cloud-based RStudio which runs projects and code in the cloud.\
RStudio Cloud allows convenient scaling and sharing of code, including for training programs such as SHARP. \
Registration for free is available via https://rstudio.cloud/ \
We will go through how to navigate RStudio Cloud in the basics folder. \
More details are available via https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide.

## What is Git?

Git is a widely used version control system. \
Version control, or source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. \
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. \
In an academic context, it is useful to collaborate on a common project where you can all see the changes which are being made, and then there ends up being a master version once all suggested changes have been processed.\
For the SHARP workshops, Git will be used to clone a copy of the SHARP project to use throughout the training days.\

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a for-profit company which offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. \
For most people, Git and GitHub are interchangeable, but one is the version control system used (Git), and the other is the hosting service (GitHub).
