# 01: Absolute basics of R, RStudio, RStudio Cloud, R Packages, Git, and GitHub

## What is R?

R is an interactive environment developed by statisticians for data analysis.\
A more detailed Introduction to R can be found at https://www.r-project.org. \
Below is a sample screenshot of an R session on a local computer:

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R developed by J J Allaire.\
RStudio provides a convenient graphical interface to R, making it more user-friendly, and providing many useful features.\
Such features include direct code execution, tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.\
A more detailed background on to RStudio can be found at https://www.rstudio.com/about/.

## What is RStudio Cloud?

RStudio Cloud is a cloud-based RStudio which runs projects and code in the cloud.\
RStudio Cloud allows convenient scaling and sharing of code, including for training programs such as SHARP. \
Registration for free is available via https://rstudio.cloud/ \
We will go through how to navigate RStudio Cloud in the basics folder. \
More details are available via https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide.

## What is an R package?

An R package is an important and very common form of shareable code. A package is usually downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and is usually very easy to do in RStudio Cloud. Countless example exist, including very famous examples such as [ggplot](https://epirhandbook.com/en/ggplot-basics.html) and [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/). When you first use an RStudio Cloud with a cloned GitHub project and start doing something, you will often see something like the yellow bar at the top of the window highlighted below asking if you want to install a package. The answer is almost always yes. You can assume the answer will be yes throughout this tutorial.

## What is Git?

This is just for information, as you will not be expected to be an expert on Git to participate in your SHARP course.

Git is a widely used version control system. \
Version control, or source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. \
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. \
In an academic context, it is useful to collaborate on a common project where you can all see the changes which are being made, and then there ends up being a master version once all suggested changes have been processed.\
For the SHARP workshops, Git will be used to clone a copy of the SHARP project to use throughout the training days.\

## What is GitHub?

This is just for information, as you will not be expected to be an expert on GitHub to participate in your SHARP course.

GitHub is a for-profit company which offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. \
For most people, Git and GitHub are interchangeable, but one is the version control system used (Git), and the other is the hosting service (GitHub).
