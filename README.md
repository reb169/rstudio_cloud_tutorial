# RStudio Cloud Tutorial for participants in Columbia Mailman SHARP Training

![](images/banner.png)

Short guide on how to use the great features of RStudio Cloud in conjunction with SHARP Training courses.\
This guide assumes the user has functional knowledge of R and RStudio.

Please first read through each of the md files in the [basics](#basics) folder to be able to register and access RStudio Cloud, then perform a couple of simple exercises in RStudio Cloud in the [exercises](#exercises) folder.

Total time to complete tasks ~ 1-2 hours max. 

This tutorial is NOT a guide to learning R or RStudio; there already countless fantastic guides out there!\
One example are the [RStudio Cloud Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers).
